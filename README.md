# 🌿 Baylo

**Barter, not buy.**

A mobile marketplace where people trade what they no longer use for what they actually need — no money, anywhere in the app.

## What it is

Baylo is a peer-to-peer bartering platform for thrifters and budget-conscious shoppers in Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue City, Cebu.

People list secondhand items and swap them directly with neighbours. There is no cash, no checkout, and no payment processor — the platform is **purely non-monetary** by design.

It exists because the two things that kill local bartering are trust and matching: you don't know who you're meeting, and you can rarely find someone who wants exactly what you have. Baylo addresses both.

---

## How trading works

**Pasa Leaves** are the unit of account. They cannot be bought, sold, or withdrawn — they exist only inside the app, and every Leaf in circulation traces to a ledger entry.

When two items are unequal in value, the difference can be settled three ways:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Even swap** | Nothing to settle |
| **Leaves** | The lower-value party covers the gap from their balance |
| **Deferred Points Agreement** | A recorded promise to settle the difference by a deadline |

The **DPA** is the platform's core mechanism — an in-system IOU that lets an unequal trade happen fairly without money changing hands. Both parties agree before the swap finalises, and the creditor sees the proposer's full record first.

---

## Safety

Trading with strangers means meeting strangers. Baylo is built around that.

- **Safe-Zone Hubs** — 22 curated public meetup points across Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue: malls, barangay halls, police stations, plazas
- **Two-sided confirmation codes** — both traders exchange 6-digit codes in person before a swap settles
- **ID verification** — a government ID, manually reviewed, required before posting or proposing a DPA. One ID, one account.
- **Multi-layered reputation** — trust tiers derived from completed trades and ratings, which gate trade value and DPA eligibility
- **Report, block, and moderation** — with a full admin audit trail
- **Duplicate photo detection** — perceptual hashing catches reposted listings
- **18+** — a declared age gate, checked on both client and server

Seller pickup locations are never published at full precision, and uploaded photos are stripped of EXIF location data before storage.

## Where the AI is — and isn't

Claude handles **image classification**: it reads a listing photo and suggests a category and condition, which the seller confirms or corrects. It also acts as a second stage in duplicate detection.

Item **valuation is not AI**. It's a deterministic statistical model — comparable completed trades where enough exist, a fixed per-category band where they don't, scaled by a condition multiplier. Every listing records which path produced its figure.

This is deliberate. A language model gives a different answer to the same question on different days; the valuation needs to be consistent and auditable.

## Getting started

Both repos are needed — the app is not usable without the API.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/katzennjammer/baylo-api.git
git clone https://github.com/katzennjammer/baylo-app.git
```

Full setup steps are in **[SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)**.
